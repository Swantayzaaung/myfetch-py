# myfetch-py
A fetch tool written in python

This is a small personal project. I wrote it cos I felt that neofetch was a bit too slow to run so I made my own fetch script. Feel free to use it as you wish. There aren't many options, though, as it's a simple script.

# Installation
>git clone https://github.com/Swantayzaaung/myfetch-py

>cd myfetch-py

# Running 
>Default ASCII: myfetch

>Custom ASCII: myfetch /path/to/ascii.txt

# TODO
-Support other operating systems and multiple package managers

-Support colored ASCII output

-Support ASCII files shorter than 6 characters long

If you have any solutions for these, please feel free to tell me or contribute to this project.
